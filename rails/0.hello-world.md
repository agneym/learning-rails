# Hello Rails

## Principles

1. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
2. Convention over Configuration.

## Installation 

```
gem install rails
rails --version
```

## Application

```
rails new application_name
```

There will be a lot of folders created by now. Rails Guides [has a table of the folder structure and what each folder does](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#hello-rails-bang).

For creating a Hello World, you require at minimum a controller and a view. 

* View displays information to the user.
* Controller controls the information avaiable to the view and collects information from it.

If you want to create a controller and view, you can do that with:

```
rails generate controller Welcome
```

If you want to autogenerate methods in controller, you can do that with:

```
rails generate controller Welcome index get hello
```

## Basic Console Commands

* `rails console` - Exposes a console where you can run database commands and else
* `rails server` - Starts the server
* `rails test`
* `rails generate`  - Generate the model, controller automatically, you can also install generator gems for extended functionality.
* `rails db:migrate`
* `rails db:create`
* `rails routes`
* `rails dbconsole`
* `rails new app_name`  - Creates a new application
