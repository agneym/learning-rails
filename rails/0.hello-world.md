# Hello Rails

## Principles

1. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
2. Convention over Configuration.

## Installation 

```
gem install rails
rails --version
```

## Application

```
rails new application_name
```

There will be a lot of folders created by now. Rails Guides [has a table of the folder structure and what each folder does](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#hello-rails-bang).
