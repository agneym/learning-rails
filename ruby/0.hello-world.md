# Hello World

How do we Hello World?

```ruby

## What kind of language is Ruby?

From first glance, there is indentation, just like in Python to indicate blocks/boundaries. But there also seems to be an `end` which is used to demarcate blocks. 

No semicolons or types found. Yet.

Ruby is an object oriented language for sure. 

> everything appears to Ruby as an object. Every value in Ruby is an object, even the most primitive things: strings, numbers and even true and false. Even a class itself is an object that is an instance of the Class class.

Well, that looks common to JavaScript.

## Online Compiler 

Tried out [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/ruby) and looks promising.

## Installation

MacOS and linux installations comes preinstalled with ruby. But it is better to use `rbenv` (or something similar) so that we have explicit control over the version we want to run.
