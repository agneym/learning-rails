# Variables

**Type**|**Format**
:-----|:-----
Global variable| Starts with $
Instance variable| Starts with @
Static (Class) Variable| Starts with @@
Constant*| Starts with Capital letter

Ruby does not throw an error if you reassign a constant, just a warning 🤷‍♂️ By practice they are written all caps, seperated by _. 

> In JavaScript, you can mutate objects declared with const and for that reason people have stopped using it altogether. This is just weird behavior.

Ruby has also got some weird variable scoping rules.

Ruby Classes are Constants. 🤯 Notice the starting capital letter! So are Array, Hashes.

# Data Types

Fairly basic stuff here:

* Numbers
* String (Text)
* True, False, Nil
* Symbols 
* Arrays
* Hashes

Numbers, Strings, True, False are obvious primitives for any language.

All of these are just plain objects, they even contain a method named `object_id` on them.

## Symbols

Symbols are identities. 

* Starts with a colon before it.
* Refers to an identity rather than a text
* Cannot contain spaces, so mostly can be equated to a variable (which is not assigned to anything but itself, I guess)
* Increases reference speed, because always uses the same memory when referred multiple times.

```ruby
:thing.object_id
"thing".object_id
```

## Nil

This is the `undefined` and `null` of Ruby. Defines nothing.

## Hashes 

Basically just Map/Dictionary.

```ruby
{ "one" => "eins", "two" => "zwei", "three" => "drei" } # => is called a hash rocket. how cute! 
# OR 
{ one: "eins", two: "zwei", three: "drei" }  # Ruby automatically uses symbols in this case.
```
## Arrays

The normal kind.

# Scope

A local variables's scope is defined by def/class/module/do-end.

Unlike JavaScript, a scope block can access only the variables defined inside it and not the ones enclosing it. 

Even if few lines of code is not executed, the compiler would still declare the variable and the code will not throw an undefined error. However, the variable is not _hoisted_ (unlike JS), if you try to access it above the declaration, it will throw the error.

```ruby
p a # This will throw an error
if false
  a = 'hello' 
end
p a # This would print out nil even though the declaration is not executed.
```

# Mutation 

Numbers, Symbols, True, False, Nil are immutable by design. 

But be vary **Strings** and everything else are mutable entities.

Just like JavaScript, there is `Object.freeze` and just like JavaScript it works only for a single level 🤷‍♂️. 

`Object.dup` method can be used if you want to duplicate it. 

> There are apparently ways to freeze strings. It's also going to land by default in Ruby 3.0.
