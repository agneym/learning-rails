# Functions & Classes

Almost everything in Ruby is an object.

## Functions

Because everything is an object, there are no functions. Just Methods.

It usually starts with a `def` and ends with `end`

```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a+b
end

add 1,2 
```

Notice that we did not have to explicitly return a value, the last expression returned the value itself.

## Blocks

* Enclosed with `do / end` or `{ / }`.
* Arguments enclosed within `||`

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }
# OR
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
```

> So these look like anonymous arrow functions or lambdas ðŸ¤”

### Using a Block

Where you use the `yield` will be substituted for the block _passed into_ the function. (kind of like `children` in React or `slot` in VueJS, I guess)

```ruby
def print_once
  yield
end
print_once do 
  puts "Hello world"
end
```

You can also `yield` multiple times in the same method making the block execute multiple times.

You can choose to give the block a name by:

```ruby
def explicit_block(&block)
  block.call # same as yield
end
explicit_block { puts "Explicit block called" }
```

> `&` seems to refer to something known as a proc. Have to look that up now.
