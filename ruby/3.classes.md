# Class

Class is type of an Object. Object is an instance of a class.

You can check class of an object by accessing `class` property on it.

```ruby
[1, "string", true, { a: 1 }].each do |thing|
  puts thing.class
end
=begin Output:
Integer
String
TrueClass
Hash
=end
```

## Writing a class

```ruby 
class User
  def public_profile
  end
  
  private
  def private_profile
  end
end
```

## Methods

Objects have methods on them. That is how methods exist in Ruby. 

So what about the methods we defined in [earlier functions](ruby/2.functions.md) explanation? They are called on an object called **top level scope** or `main`.

> This seems very similar to the `window` implementation in JavaScript.

### Predicate Methods

Methods that return a boolean value. These usually have a `?` suffix.

```ruby
5.odd? # true
"Yukihiro Matsumoto".include?("Matz") # false
```

### Bang Methods

Bang methods end with an `!` mark and **often** modify the object it is called on.
