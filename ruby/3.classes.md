# Class

Class is type of an Object. Object is an instance of a class.

You can check class of an object by accessing `class` property on it.

```ruby
[1, "string", true, { a: 1 }].each do |thing|
  puts thing.class
end
=begin Output:
Integer
String
TrueClass
Hash
=end
```

## Writing a class

```ruby 
class User
end
```

## Methods

Objects have methods on them. That is how methods exist in Ruby. 

So what about the methods we defined in [earlier functions](ruby/2.functions.md) explanation? They are called on an object called **top level scope** or `main`.

> This seems very similar to the `window` implementation in JavaScript.

### Predicate Methods

Methods that return a boolean value. These usually have a `?` suffix.

```ruby
5.odd? # true
"Yukihiro Matsumoto".include?("Matz") # false
```

### Bang Methods

Bang methods end with an `!` mark and **often** modify the object it is called on.


```ruby 
class User
  # acts as a constructor
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # an attribute reader - getter basically
  def name
    @name
  end

  # an attribute writer - setter basically
  def age=(age)
    @age = age
  end

  private 
  def age
    @age
  end
end

user = User.new("Aaron")
```

* Modifiers are public, private and protected. Methods on a class are by default `public`. 
* Modifiers are also like starting blocks, enclosing all methods beneath it till the next modifier (or `end`).

## Self

Refers to the object itself.
