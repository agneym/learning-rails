# Conditions & Loops

## Conditions

`if`, `elsif` and `else` ending with `end`.
```ruby
font_size = 5.5

if font_size == 5
  puts "Pearl"
elsif font_size == 5.5
  puts "Ruby"
else
  puts "Some other size"
end
```

### unless

```ruby
puts "Always true" if not false
puts "Always true" unless false
```

## Logical Operators

* `and` and `&&`
* `or` and `||`
* `not` and `!`

`&&`, `||`, `!` precede over `and`, `or`, `not`.

## Comparison Operators

First, let's consider `=`:

While numbers, strings and booleans works as expected, there is the case of arrays:

```ruby
p [1, 2] == [1, 2]  # true
p [1, 2] == [2, 1]  # false
```
If you wanted to check references, then you can check `equal?` on the array.

> Ruby has an operator `<=>` Spaceship Operator which returns 1, 0, -1.
